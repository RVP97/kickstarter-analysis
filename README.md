# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
The project contains an *excel* analyzing the findings on various years worth of data o fundraising campaigns.

**Pivot tables** were used to better visualize data.
<br>
**VLOOKUP** was used to extract data from the main sheet to a secondary one
<br>
**Conditional formatting** was used to color code our data depending on its value

## Findings
Failed campaigns, on average, asked for almost double the money than successful ones.
<br>
The time of the year seemed to have an impact on the outcome of the campaign.
<br>
Failed campaigns had greater outliers skewing the data than successful campaigns.
<br>
The next image shows the outcome by category:

Louise should **strongly** consider asking for a sum of money within range and launching her campaign in a strategic month.
